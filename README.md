# HyperGCode-4D

**Next-Generation 3D Printing G-Code for Parallelized Multi-Valve Extrusion**

---

## Overview

HyperGCode-4D is an experimental extension of traditional G-code designed for **parallelized 3D printing**. Unlike conventional G-code, which moves a single nozzle along the X, Y, and Z axes, HyperGCode-4D introduces a **new operational paradigm**:

- The **Z-axis is treated as a layer plane**, where **all X,Y points on that plane can be activated simultaneously**.
- Each X,Y coordinate can have multiple **valves/extrusion channels** for routing materials, colors, or functions.
- Conceptually, this introduces a “4th operational dimension”: **coordinated valve/routing control across X,Y per layer**, effectively abstracting movement into **simultaneous extrusion control rather than mechanical motion**.

This allows for:
- Parallelized deposition.
- Multi-material or multi-color printing with minimal hardware.
- Potential applications in **nano-fabrication**, **bio-printing**, or **advanced material deposition**.

## New G-Code Instructions

| Command | Function |
|---------|---------|
| `G4D X10 Y20 Z0.5 V1:O V2:C` | Activate valves at X=10, Y=20, Z=0.5. V1 Open, V2 Closed |
| `G4L Z0.6` | Advance Z-layer plane to 0.6 mm without moving X,Y |
| `G4C COLOR R255 G0 B0` | Set color mixing parameters for connected valves |
| `G4S SPEED 50` | Set flow rate/speed for all active valves on layer |
| `G4H TEMP 200` | Set heating for shared extrusion network |

> `G4D` = 4D Deposit (activates valve configuration per X,Y for current Z)  
> `G4L` = Layer Advance (Z increment)  
> `G4C` = Color / Material assignment  
> `G4S` = Flow Speed / extrusion coordination  
> `G4H` = Heating for shared channels

## Design Considerations

### 1. Printer Architecture
- A **full-plane Z-head base** supporting multiple print heads or valves.
- Each X,Y node can have **4 interconnected valves**.
- Routing network allows single extruder per color with shared distribution.
- Must ensure **heating and pressure stability** for simultaneous flow.

### 2. Layer Coordination
- Z-movement is **layer-only**, all X,Y coordinates active simultaneously.
- Avoids gaps or dry deposition by controlling valve timing.
- Supports complex deposition patterns without mechanical X,Y movement.

### 3. Material Handling
- Shared channels require careful **valve control** to avoid cross-contamination.
- Multi-material or multi-color systems require **dynamic valve routing** per X,Y node.

### 4. Potential Applications
- **4D G-code abstraction** can inspire other fields:
    - Bio-printing: coordinate multiple cell types per plane.
    - Nano-fabrication: parallel deposition of functional materials.
    - Advanced robotics: routing commands across a 2D array simultaneously.

## Example Workflow

1. Import your model (`.STL`) into a **4D slicer**.
2. Generate **HyperGCode-4D instructions** layer by layer:
    - Activate all X,Y nodes at Z=0.2mm with valves per material.
    - Set flow, color, and heating per node.
    - Advance Z-layer after completion (`G4L Z0.4`).
3. Execute G-code on compatible printer base with **valve-interconnected X,Y array**.

## Example G-Code Snippet

G4H TEMP 200 G4C COLOR R255 G0 B0 G4D X0 Y0 Z0.2 V1:O V2:C V3:O V4:C G4D X10 Y0 Z0.2 V1:C V2:O V3:O V4:C G4D X0 Y10 Z0.2 V1:O V2:O V3:C V4:C G4L Z0.4 G4D X0 Y0 Z0.4 V1:O V2:O V3:O V4:O

## Notes

- This is **experimental** and currently theoretical.
- The concept extends G-code into **a 4th operational dimension**: simultaneous layer-wide valve routing.
- Hardware implementation requires **new printer architecture**, heating, pressure management, and slicer integration.
