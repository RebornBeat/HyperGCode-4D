# Model Selection Guide

## HyperCube-4D Mini
**Best For**: Education, research, proof-of-concept, learning  
**Considerations**: Limited build volume, single material focus, manual operation  
**Investment**: ~$3,000

## HyperCube-4D Standard
**Best For**: Small business, prototyping, low-volume production, dual-material  
**Considerations**: Good balance of capability and cost, proven architecture  
**Investment**: ~$12,500

## HyperCube-4D Pro
**Best For**: Advanced research, high-end prototyping, multi-material complexity  
**Considerations**: High precision, quad-material, advanced features  
**Investment**: ~$48,000

## HyperCube-4D Industrial
**Best For**: Production manufacturing, 24/7 operation, factory integration  
**Considerations**: Maximum reliability, serviceability, throughput  
**Investment**: ~$185,000

All models share core HyperGCode-4D principles and can run the same sliced files (with appropriate scaling for different grid densities). This allows development on smaller systems with deployment to production systems.
