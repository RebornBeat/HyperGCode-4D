# HyperGCode-4D Slicer

The HyperGCode-4D Slicer transforms traditional 3D models into instructions for parallelized valve-based deposition. Unlike conventional slicers that generate toolpaths for a moving print head, this slicer generates valve activation patterns for simultaneous deposition across entire X,Y planes.

## Conceptual Foundation

Traditional slicers solve the problem of "how should a single nozzle move through space to build this shape?" The HyperGCode-4D slicer asks fundamentally different questions: "At each Z height, which valve nodes should activate simultaneously?" and "How should material route through the valve network to reach each deposition point?" This shift from kinematic planning to topological routing planning represents the core innovation of the slicing process.

## Architecture Overview

The slicer is implemented as a Rust library with both command-line and graphical interfaces. The modular architecture allows components to be reused across different interfaces while maintaining a clear separation of concerns between geometric processing, routing logic, and output generation.

### Core Modules

The **mesh loader** handles input of 3D models in standard formats including STL, OBJ, and 3MF. It validates mesh integrity, ensures proper scaling, and prepares the geometry for layer-based processing. The loader detects and reports common mesh issues like non-manifold edges, intersecting faces, or inverted normals that would cause problems during slicing.

The **layer generator** slices the 3D model into horizontal planes corresponding to Z heights. For each layer, it computes the cross-section of the model at that height, generating polygonal regions that need material deposition. Unlike traditional slicers that create toolpaths within these regions, the layer generator identifies which grid points fall inside versus outside the model geometry.

The **valve mapper** translates geometric requirements into valve activation patterns. For each layer, it determines which X,Y grid coordinates need material deposition and calculates the valve states required to achieve that deposition. This includes routing material from injection points through the valve network to reach interior regions of the model.

The **path optimizer** determines efficient routing strategies that minimize material waste, balance pressure distribution across the valve network, reduce purge requirements when switching materials, and avoid deadlock situations where multiple routing paths conflict. This optimization problem differs fundamentally from toolpath optimization in traditional slicing, as it involves network flow rather than Euclidean path planning.

The **material handler** manages multi-material and multi-color printing by assigning material types to model regions, calculating purge volumes needed when materials transition, planning purge sequences that minimize waste, and generating valve routing that keeps materials separated until deposition. When multiple materials meet at a grid point, it determines whether to purge, blend, or use timing separation.

The **pressure simulator** models fluid flow through the valve network to predict pressure distributions, identify flow bottlenecks, validate that planned routing is physically achievable, and suggest adjustments to improve flow uniformity. This simulation helps catch issues before they manifest as print failures.

The **G-code generator** translates the routing plan into HyperGCode-4D commands. It produces properly formatted G4D commands with valve states, generates G4L commands for layer advances, includes G4C commands for material/color changes, adds G4S and G4H commands for flow and thermal control, and packages everything into the .hg4d binary format with appropriate headers and checksums.

## Input and Output

The slicer accepts standard 3D model formats as input. STL files provide simple triangle mesh representation suitable for single-material models. OBJ files support vertex colors or multiple objects for multi-material assignment. 3MF files include embedded material and color information in a modern format designed for 3D printing workflows.

The primary output is an .hg4d file, a binary format specifically designed for HyperGCode-4D printing. This format includes a header section with printer configuration metadata, material profile references, model bounding box and statistics, and estimated print time and material usage. The layer section contains Z-height definitions, complete valve activation patterns for each grid point, timing parameters for valve switching, and pressure control parameters. A footer includes checksums for data integrity verification and markers for resumable printing after failures.

## Configuration System

The slicer requires detailed configuration describing the target printer's capabilities and the materials being used. This configuration profoundly affects how the slicer generates valve activation patterns.

Printer configurations specify the build volume dimensions and reachable Z height, the X,Y grid spacing defining valve node density, the number of valves per grid point (4, 8, or more), valve response characteristics including switching time and dead volume, material injection point locations across the build plane, pressure system capabilities including maximum supply pressure and flow rate, thermal management including heated zones and temperature ranges, and the physical routing network topology describing which valves connect to which neighbors.

Material profiles define the extrusion temperature range, flow characteristics including viscosity and compressibility, retraction/purge requirements, cooling requirements for proper layer adhesion, and compatibility with other materials in multi-material printing. When multiple materials are configured, the slicer needs additional information about dead volume in shared channels, purge sequences to prevent contamination, and whether materials can blend or must remain strictly separated.

## Slicing Algorithm

The complete slicing process proceeds through several phases, each building on the outputs of previous stages.

In the **geometry processing phase**, the slicer loads and validates the 3D model, applies any requested transformations like scaling or rotation, identifies regions requiring support structures if the printer configuration includes support material, and separates the model into material zones if it contains multiple materials. The result is a validated geometric representation ready for layer-based processing.

During **layer generation**, the system determines appropriate layer heights based on model geometry and printer capabilities, computes cross-sections at each Z height, converts cross-sections to polygonal regions, and identifies which grid points fall within material regions versus empty space. For complex geometries with overhangs, it generates support structure regions that will be fabricated from support material.

The **routing planning phase** addresses the unique challenge of material distribution through a valve network. For each layer, the planner identifies which grid points need material deposition, determines which material injection points will supply each region, calculates routing paths through valve activations from sources to destinations, optimizes to balance pressure and avoid conflicts, and generates timing sequences for valve operations. This phase may iterate with the pressure simulator to refine routing plans that

 initially appear problematic.

In **multi-material handling**, when the model requires multiple materials, the system assigns materials to appropriate grid points, inserts purge sequences at material boundaries, calculates purge volumes based on contamination tolerance, and schedules material routing to minimize switching frequency. The goal is producing clean material transitions while minimizing waste deposited in purge zones.

The **output generation phase** packages all planning decisions into the .hg4d format, creating properly sequenced HyperGCode-4D commands, embedding printer and material configuration references, including metadata for print monitoring and estimation, and computing checksums for data integrity. The resulting file is ready for transfer to the printer firmware.

## Graphical User Interface

The GUI provides visual feedback and control throughout the slicing process. Users can import 3D models and see them rendered in the build volume, adjust position, rotation, and scale interactively, configure printer settings through dialogs, assign materials to model regions through painting or selection tools, and preview the sliced result before generating the final .hg4d file.

The preview visualization shows layer-by-layer views of the model, valve activation patterns at each layer displayed as a heat map or grid, material routing paths animated through the valve network, estimated print time and material usage, and potential issues like unreachable regions or pressure problems. This immediate visual feedback helps users understand what the printer will actually do and catch problems before starting the print.

## Command-Line Interface

For automation and batch processing, the CLI accepts all parameters as command-line arguments or configuration files. Users can slice multiple models with consistent settings, integrate slicing into build pipelines or workflows, run headless on servers without GUI dependencies, and script complex multi-model printing jobs. The CLI provides detailed logging and error reporting for troubleshooting.

## Performance Considerations

Slicing for valve-based parallel deposition is computationally intensive due to the network routing optimization problem. The slicer employs several strategies to maintain acceptable performance:

Parallel processing exploits multi-core processors by slicing layers independently where possible and running routing optimization across multiple cores. Incremental updates reuse previous computations when users make small changes to avoid complete reslicing. Adaptive resolution uses finer grid spacing only in regions requiring high detail. Heuristic optimization employs fast approximation algorithms for routing rather than exhaustive search.

Even with these optimizations, slicing large, complex models for high-density valve arrays may take minutes rather than the seconds typical of conventional slicing. This trade-off is acceptable given that the print time savings from parallel deposition far exceed the additional slicing time.

## Development and Extension

The slicer is designed for extensibility. Developers can add new input format support through the mesh loader interface, implement alternative routing algorithms by providing new path optimizers, create custom material profiles for novel filament types, develop plugins for specialized geometry processing, and integrate with external simulation tools for advanced validation.

The Rust implementation provides memory safety and concurrency without garbage collection overhead, making it suitable for both desktop applications and potential embedded deployment. The library architecture allows the core slicing logic to be reused in other tools like simulators or analysis utilities.

## Testing and Validation

Comprehensive testing ensures the slicer generates valid, printable instructions. Unit tests verify each module's correctness in isolation. Integration tests confirm that modules work together properly. Geometric tests use known shapes to validate correct layer generation. Routing tests verify valve activation patterns achieve the intended material distribution. Format tests ensure .hg4d output conforms to specification. Regression tests catch unintended changes in behavior during development.

The test suite includes a library of challenging models that exercise different aspects of the slicing algorithm, from simple geometric shapes to complex multi-material assemblies. Continuous integration runs the full test suite on every code change to maintain quality.

## Future Enhancements

The slicer roadmap includes several areas for improvement and expansion:

Advanced routing optimization could employ machine learning to predict optimal routing strategies based on geometry and material properties. Real-time pressure simulation during slicing would provide more accurate feasibility validation. Automatic support generation specifically designed for valve-based printing would reduce material waste. Integration with topology optimization could generate designs that exploit the unique capabilities of parallel deposition. Cloud-based slicing could offload computation for very large or complex models.

As practical experience with HyperGCode-4D printing accumulates, the slicing algorithms will evolve to incorporate lessons learned and best practices discovered through real-world usage.
